A)  
1. From birth to about 6 months, infants are very sensitive to different speech sounds and can discriminate many phonemes from many languages.  
2. Around 4–6 months, babies begin babbling, producing repetitive consonant–vowel sounds like “ba-ba” or “da-da.”  
3. Around 10–12 months, infants usually say their first recognizable words, such as “mama” or “ball.”  
4. By about 24 months (around 2 years), children typically start combining two or more words into simple sentences, like “want juice” or “Daddy go.”

B)  
Broca’s area, in the frontal lobe, is crucial for language production and grammatical processing; damage here leads to slow, effortful speech with relatively preserved comprehension.  
Wernicke’s area, in the temporal lobe, is crucial for understanding spoken language and for producing meaningful speech; damage here leads to fluent but often nonsensical speech and poor comprehension.

C)  
Prototype theory is the idea that when we categorize something, we rely on a loose, fuzzy picture of what members of a category are usually like, instead of using strict, rule-based definitions.  

Exemplar theory says that we categorize items by checking whether they match a single, abstract prototype that stands for the whole category.

D)  
Belief bias is when our preexisting beliefs and opinions interfere with logical reasoning, so we tend to go along with conclusions that fit what we already think.  

The illusory truth effect is when information that we encounter repeatedly starts to feel more familiar and we react to it as if it were less surprising or noteworthy simply because we have heard it before.
