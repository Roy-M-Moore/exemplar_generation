A) Psychologists often describe emotions along two dimensions.  
Arousal is how intense or activated the emotion feels, such as low, calm feelings versus very strong, fired‑up feelings.  
Valence is more like the general tone or quality of the emotion, the direction of the feeling along a kind of emotional scale.

B) The James-Lange theory says that emotions are closely tied to changes in the body. According to this view, when something happens, our body reacts (like our heart rate and breathing changing), and our experience of emotion is based on these bodily reactions, though it’s often talked about as all happening together.  

The two-factor (Schachter-Singer) theory emphasizes that we interpret what we feel. It says that we look at what is going on around us and use the situation to decide what specific emotion we are having, basically labeling our feeling based on context.

C) One pathway for emotion is a fast route that sends incoming information quickly into the amygdala and helps trigger immediate fear or threat responses without much detailed thinking about the situation.  

A second, slower pathway involves sending the information to cortical areas. There, the brain can think about and evaluate the emotional situation in more detail and with more conscious processing before responding.

D) Intrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from inside the person, when someone is pushed by internal reasons rather than outside factors.  

Extrinsic motivation is when the drive to do something comes from outside, such as external demands or pressures from other people or the environment.
