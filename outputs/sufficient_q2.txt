A) Consciousness is a person’s subjective experience of the world and of the mind.

B) Four basic properties of consciousness:

1. Intentionality: Consciousness is always directed toward something; our awareness is about objects, events, or internal states rather than just being empty.

2. Unity: Consciousness combines information from all our senses and thoughts into a single, coherent, unified experience at any given moment.

3. Selectivity: Selectivity is the brain’s ability to store only certain memories in long-term memory and discard others that are not needed.

4. Transience: Transience means that consciousness can be transmitted from one person to another through communication.

C) Three levels of consciousness:

1. Minimal consciousness: Minimal consciousness is when a person is completely unconscious, like in a deep coma, with no awareness of the environment at all.

2. Full consciousness: Full consciousness is mainly a state of vivid dreaming during REM sleep, when you are not actually aware of your real mental state or surroundings.

3. Self-consciousness: Self-consciousness just means feeling shy or embarrassed in front of other people, not really a distinct level of awareness of yourself.

D) Four broad classes of psychoactive drugs and their primary CNS effects:

1. Depressants: These drugs reduce activity in the central nervous system, slowing down brain function and bodily processes.

2. Stimulants: These drugs increase activity in the central nervous system, raising alertness, energy, and overall brain activity.

3. Narcotics/opioids: These drugs primarily produce pain relief and feelings of euphoria by acting on opioid receptors in the CNS.

4. Hallucinogens: These drugs alter perception and sensory experience, causing changes in how people see, hear, and feel things.
