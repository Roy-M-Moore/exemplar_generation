A) Proactive aggression is deliberate, planned aggression used as a tool to obtain some goal or reward, like hurting someone to gain status or resources.  
Reactive aggression is impulsive, emotion-driven aggression that occurs in response to a provocation or perceived threat, often accompanied by anger or frustration.

B) Altruism is when a person helps someone else for their benefit rather than for a reward, like doing something kind for another person.  
In-group favouritism is when people are harsher toward members of their own group than toward people from outside groups.

C) The cognitive error is the fundamental attribution error (also called correspondence bias). It is the tendency to explain other people’s behaviour mainly in terms of their internal traits or dispositions (such as being irresponsible) while underestimating the influence of situational factors (like traffic or a late bus).
