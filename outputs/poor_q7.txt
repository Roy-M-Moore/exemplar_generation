A) Intelligence is how fast your brain works, and IQ is measured simply by counting how many questions you answer correctly on an intelligence test.

B) The fact that monozygotic twins have higher IQ correlations than dizygotic twins proves that sharing the same home environment is the only major reason for their similarity, and that genes are not important. The heritability coefficient (h²) is just an individual’s own percentage of intelligence that comes from the way they were raised.

C) Three environmental influences on measured IQ are:
1. Socioeconomic status (for example, growing up in poverty versus in a wealthy family).
2. Education (how much schooling and the quality of that schooling).
3. Nutrition (especially the adequacy of diet during childhood).
