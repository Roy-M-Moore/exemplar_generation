A) Personality is an individual’s characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that tend to be relatively consistent and stable over time and across situations.

B) The Big Five personality factors are:
1. Openness to Experience  
2. Conscientiousness  
3. Extraversion  
4. Agreeableness  
5. Neuroticism  

C) Three pieces of empirical evidence for a biological basis of personality traits are:
1. Twin studies show that identical twins are more similar to each other in traits like extraversion or neuroticism than fraternal twins, suggesting substantial heritability of personality.  
2. Animal studies find consistent temperament differences (such as bold vs. shy behavior) in species like primates and dogs, implying that biologically based mechanisms underlie personality-like traits across species.  
3. Cross-cultural studies show that similar personality trait structures (like the Big Five) appear in many different cultures, which some researchers take as indirect evidence that biology must play a role.

D) In the psychodynamic approach:
- The id is the part of the mind present at birth that contains innate drives and instincts; it operates on the pleasure principle and seeks immediate gratification of basic needs, wants, desires, and impulses.  
- The ego develops as the person interacts with reality; it operates on the reality principle and is responsible for dealing with the external world and managing the practical demands of life while mediating between the id and the superego.  
- The superego is the internalized representation of cultural, parental, and moral standards; it functions as a kind of conscience, judging thoughts and actions according to these moral rules and ideals.
