A)  
Four key developmental milestones in early language acquisition:  

1. Around 18 months, infants first begin to hear and distinguish individual phonemes in their native language.  
2. Babbling typically begins around 4–6 months, when babies start producing repetitive consonant–vowel sounds like “bababa.”  
3. First words usually do not appear until about 18–24 months, when children start using single words for whole ideas.  
4. Simple sentences only emerge around 4 years of age, when children can put several words together in a meaningful order.  

B)  
Broca’s area, located in the left frontal lobe, is primarily involved in language production and grammatical processing; damage here leads to difficulty forming fluent, grammatically correct speech.  

Wernicke’s area, in the left temporal lobe, is primarily involved in language comprehension and understanding meaning; damage here leads to fluent but often nonsensical speech and problems understanding language.  

C)  
Prototype theory says we categorize new things by comparing them to specific remembered instances we’ve encountered before.  

Exemplar theory says we categorize new things by comparing them to one ideal, most typical example of the category.  

D)  
Belief bias is when people are more likely to judge arguments as valid if they come from an authority figure.  

The illusory truth effect is when people accept information as true if it confirms what they already believe.
