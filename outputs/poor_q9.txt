A) Proactive aggression is when a person takes the initiative to cooperate with others in a peaceful way before any conflict happens. Reactive aggression is when a person calmly plans how to solve a problem without getting emotional.

B) Altruism is when people only help others if they expect a reward or benefit for themselves. In-group favouritism is when someone treats everyone equally, no matter what group they belong to.

C) The cognitive error is the fundamental attribution error (also called correspondence bias). It is the tendency to explain another person’s behaviour mainly in terms of their internal traits or dispositions (such as being irresponsible) while overlooking or downplaying situational factors (such as traffic or a delayed bus) that could have caused the behaviour.
