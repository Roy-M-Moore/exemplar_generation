A) In classical conditioning, some stimulus pairings are learned more easily simply because the stimuli are more intense or occur more frequently together, so the organism notices them more. For example, a very loud sound paired with a light might be learned faster than a soft sound. A brain structure that is important for fear conditioning is the hippocampus.  

B) Positive reinforcement is when you add a pleasant or rewarding stimulus after a behaviour so that the behaviour is more likely to occur again in the future. Negative reinforcement is when you remove or take away an unpleasant or aversive stimulus after a behaviour in order to increase the chances that the behaviour will happen again.  

C) Shaping is an operant conditioning technique in which you reinforce successive approximations of the target behaviour, gradually rewarding behaviours that get closer and closer to the final desired response.  

D) Observational learning is a kind of learning that happens without us being aware of it, where we pick up patterns automatically from the environment. Implicit learning is when we deliberately watch and imitate a model to learn a new behaviour. One system involved in observational learning is general frontal lobe regions that help us understand and interpret the actions of other people.
