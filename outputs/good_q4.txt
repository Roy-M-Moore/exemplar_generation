A) Some stimulus pairings are learned more easily because organisms are biologically prepared, through evolution, to associate certain types of stimuli with certain outcomes (for example, taste with nausea or snakes with danger), so those pairings are formed more rapidly than arbitrary ones. A key brain structure for fear conditioning is the amygdala.

B) Positive reinforcement is when you increase the likelihood of a behaviour by presenting or adding a desirable stimulus after that behaviour (for example, giving a child praise or candy for doing homework).  
Negative reinforcement is when you increase the likelihood of a behaviour by removing or reducing an aversive stimulus after that behaviour (for example, fastening your seatbelt to stop the annoying car beeping).

C) Shaping is a process in which you reinforce successive approximations of a target behaviour, gradually rewarding behaviours that get closer and closer to the final desired response.

D) Observational learning is when a person improves a skill mainly by practicing it repeatedly through trial-and-error conditioning. Implicit learning happens when someone consciously studies and memorizes explicit rules and facts. A neural system involved in observational learning is the hippocampus, which directly mirrors other people’s movements.
