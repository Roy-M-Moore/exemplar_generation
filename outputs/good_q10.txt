A) A stressor is any event, situation, or demand that is perceived as threatening a person’s well-being or that requires them to adjust or cope.  
An acute stressor is short-term or time-limited, like a sudden exam or a minor car accident.  
A chronic stressor is ongoing or long-term, such as persistent financial problems or caring for a chronically ill family member.

B) The primary hormonal axis involved in the physiological response to a threat is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.  
When a threat is perceived, the hypothalamus becomes activated and releases signals (such as CRH) to the pituitary gland. The pituitary then releases ACTH into the bloodstream, which travels to the adrenal cortex. In response, the adrenal cortex secretes cortisol and other stress hormones, which help mobilize energy and prepare the body to deal with the stressor.
