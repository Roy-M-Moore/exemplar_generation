A) A stressor is any event or demand that puts pressure on a person and threatens their well-being or requires them to adjust or cope in some way. An acute stressor is a long-lasting, ongoing strain that continues for years, while a chronic stressor is a brief, one-time shock that is over quickly.

B) The body’s physiological response to a threat primarily involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. I don’t remember the specific steps of how this axis works or what hormones are released in order.

C) I’m not sure about the three phases of the general adaptation syndrome, so I can’t accurately describe them.
