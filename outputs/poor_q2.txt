A) Consciousness is a person’s subjective experience of the world and of their own mind.

B)
- Intentionality: This means that consciousness is always about something; it is directed toward objects, events, or thoughts rather than being empty.
- Unity: Unity means being one person with a single identity, so consciousness is just the feeling of being the same person all the time.
- Selectivity: Selectivity means being aware of everything around you at once, without leaving anything out of your experience.
- Transience: Transience means that consciousness basically stays the same over time and does not really change unless you go to sleep.

C)
- Minimal consciousness: This is the highest form of awareness where a person is fully reflective about who they are and can report all their thoughts.
- Full consciousness: This level refers to when someone is not really aware of their own mental state, like being unconscious during deep sleep.
- Self-consciousness: This is just a simple awareness of basic sights and sounds in the environment, without thinking about yourself at all.

D)
- Depressants: These drugs reduce CNS activity and slow down brain and body functions.
- Stimulants: These drugs increase CNS activity, speeding up mental and physical processes.
- Narcotics/opioids: These are mainly used to keep people awake and make them more alert.
- Hallucinogens: These primarily calm the nervous system in the same way as a strong sleeping pill.
