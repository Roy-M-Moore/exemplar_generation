A) In classical conditioning, some stimulus pairings are learned more easily simply because they are repeated more times in a row, so the organism just gets used to them through practice. A key brain structure for fear conditioning is the hippocampus, which stores the memory of the shocking events.

B) Positive reinforcement means giving or adding something desirable after a behavior so that the behavior is more likely to happen again, like giving a child candy for doing homework. Negative reinforcement is when you add a negative consequence to make a behavior happen less often.

C) Shaping is a process in which you reinforce successive approximations of a desired behavior, rewarding small steps that get closer and closer to the final target behavior.

D) Observational learning is when an individual gradually improves a skill by repeatedly practicing it alone without feedback. Implicit learning is when you consciously study material and deliberately memorize rules. A neural system involved in observational learning is the visual cortex that processes the images you see while practicing.
