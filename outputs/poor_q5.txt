A) Psychologists often describe one dimension of emotion as arousal, meaning the level of physiological activation or alertness in the body, like increased heart rate or sweating. Valence is basically how intense an emotion feels.

B) The James-Lange theory says we first feel an emotion and then our body reacts, while the Schachter-Singer theory says that different emotions come from distinct brain systems rather than how we interpret our bodily arousal.

C) One pathway for emotion goes mainly through the frontal lobe and quickly creates a conscious feeling, while the other pathway goes through the brainstem and processes the emotion more slowly over time.

D) Intrinsic motivation means doing an activity because you find it interesting, enjoyable, or satisfying in itself, like reading a novel because you love the story. Extrinsic motivation means doing something to get an external reward or avoid punishment, like studying only to get a good grade or to avoid failing.
