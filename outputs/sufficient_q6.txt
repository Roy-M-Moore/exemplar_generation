A)  
Four key milestones in early language acquisition are:

1. Around 8–10 months, infants first really begin to discriminate different speech sounds (phonemes) from various languages; before this age they generally cannot tell phonemes apart.  
2. Babbling typically begins around 4–6 months, when babies start producing repetitive consonant-vowel sounds like “ba-ba” or “da-da.”  
3. First recognizable words usually appear around 10–12 months, when children begin to use single words like “mama” or “ball” to refer to specific people or objects.  
4. Simple sentences, often two-word combinations like “more juice” or “mommy go,” emerge around 24 months (about 2 years of age).

B)  
Broca’s area is located in the frontal lobe and is mainly responsible for language production, especially forming fluent speech and handling grammatical structure.  

Wernicke’s area is another frontal region that primarily controls the motor movements of the mouth and tongue needed to articulate speech sounds.

C)  
Prototype theory says that we categorize things by comparing them to an idealized or “average” member of a category in our mind (a prototype), and we judge membership based on how similar something is to that best example.  

Exemplar theory says we use a single overall rule or label to put things into categories, rather than relying on memories of individual category members.

D)  
Belief bias is when people stubbornly hold on to their existing beliefs even when they are given strong evidence that contradicts those beliefs.  

The illusory truth effect is when hearing the same statement over and over makes people increasingly likely to think it is false just because they are tired of hearing it.
