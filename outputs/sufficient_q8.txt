B) Extraversion; Neuroticism; Curiosity or imagination; Honesty; Intelligence.

C) One piece of evidence is from twin studies: identical twins reared apart often show more similar personality traits than fraternal twins, suggesting a heritable, biological basis for traits like extraversion or neuroticism.  
Another piece of supposed evidence is that people with similar personalities tend to choose similar hobbies, such as reading or sports, which shows that lifestyle shapes personality.  
A third point is that different cultures encourage certain traits more than others, so cultural norms rather than biology are the main cause of personality patterns.

D) The id is basically the rational part of the mind that deals with reality and logic.  
The ego is the part of personality that develops as we interact with the external world and tries to balance our inner needs with the demands of reality in everyday life.  
The superego is the primitive instinctive part that seeks immediate gratification of basic urges like hunger, sex, and aggression.
