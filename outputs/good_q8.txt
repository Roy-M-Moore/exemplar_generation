A) Personality is an individual’s characteristic way of thinking and acting that makes them different from others.

B) The Big Five personality factors are:
- Openness to Experience  
- Conscientiousness  
- Extraversion  
- Agreeableness  
- Neuroticism  

C)  
1. Twin studies: Researchers compare identical and fraternal twins and find that identical twins are more similar in traits such as extraversion and neuroticism, even when they are raised apart, indicating that personality traits are heritable.  
2. Animal studies: Studies of animals, such as different breeds of dogs or primates, show consistent temperament differences and use selective breeding and other biological manipulations to demonstrate that these personality-like traits have genetic and biological underpinnings.  
3. Physiological research: Research on brain and arousal systems links biological functioning to personality, for example studies suggesting that introverts have higher baseline levels of cortical arousal (or reticular formation activity) than extraverts, which helps explain differences in sociability and stimulation-seeking.

D)  
Id: In the psychodynamic approach, the id is the part of the mind present at birth that contains instinctive drives and basic needs, operating on impulses and seeking immediate gratification of desires.  

Ego: The ego is basically the moral conscience that tells us what is right and wrong and tries to make us feel guilty when we do something bad.  

Superego: The superego is the realistic, problem‑solving part that deals with the outside world and makes practical decisions to satisfy our drives.
