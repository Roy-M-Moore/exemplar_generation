A) Encoding is just the process of storing information in long-term memory; it doesn’t really involve perception, it’s mainly about putting information away so it can be kept for later.

B) The testing effect is the idea that tests are used to measure what students know, and the more tests you take, the more anxious or tired you might feel about the material.

C) Working memory is a limited-capacity system in which we actively hold and mentally manipulate information we are currently using, like when solving a math problem in your head or following multi-step directions. Without rehearsal, information can stay there for up to several minutes before it fades.

D) Implicit memory is a type of memory that operates outside of conscious awareness and still affects our behavior or performance, such as knowing how to ride a bike or being more likely to identify a word you’ve recently seen (priming). Explicit memory is basically the same thing, but it refers to habits and skills that you do automatically without thinking about them.
