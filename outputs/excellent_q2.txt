A) Consciousness is a person’s subjective experience of the world and the mind.

B)  
Intentionality: Consciousness has intentionality because it is always directed toward or about something—objects, events, thoughts, or states of the world or the mind.  

Unity: Unity means consciousness integrates information from many senses and mental processes into a single, coherent, unified experience at any given moment.  

Selectivity: Selectivity refers to the ability of consciousness to focus attention, including some pieces of information and excluding or filtering out others.  

Transience: Transience means that consciousness stays the same and does not really change over time, remaining fixed on one content.

C)  
Minimal consciousness: Minimal consciousness is a low-level kind of awareness where the mind registers sensory input and may produce simple behavior, like turning toward a loud noise or reacting to pain, without deeper reflective thought.  

Full consciousness: Full consciousness is when you are not only experiencing mental states but are also aware of them and can describe or report what you are thinking, feeling, or perceiving.  

Self-consciousness: Self-consciousness is a level of consciousness in which attention is directed toward the self as an object, so you become aware of yourself, your characteristics, and how you appear to others.

D)  
Depressants: Depressants reduce CNS activity, slowing brain function and neural firing.  

Stimulants: Stimulants increase CNS activity, heightening alertness, energy, and neural firing.  

Narcotics/opioids: Narcotics or opioids produce pain relief (analgesia) and can create feelings of intense pleasure or euphoria.  

Hallucinogens: Hallucinogens alter perception and sensory experience, often producing vivid visual or auditory distortions and changes in the way reality is experienced.
