A) A stressor is any event, situation, or demand that threatens a person’s well-being or requires them to adjust or adapt.  
An acute stressor is short-term and time-limited, such as taking an exam or getting stuck in traffic once. A chronic stressor is long-lasting or persistent, such as ongoing financial problems or caring for a chronically ill family member over months or years.

B) When a person detects a threat, the brain turns on a hormonal stress response in which brain centers send signals to the adrenal glands, causing them to release stress hormones like cortisol into the bloodstream. These hormones help the body deal with the threat by increasing things like heart rate and energy so the person can respond.

C) The three phases of the general adaptation syndrome are the denial phase, the anger phase, and the acceptance phase. In the denial phase, the person refuses to believe what is happening. In the anger phase, they feel frustrated and mad about the situation. In the acceptance phase, they come to terms with what has happened and try to move on.
