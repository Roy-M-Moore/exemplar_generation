A) Encoding is the process of learning or taking in information so that you can remember it later. It generally involves paying attention and using strategies like repetition or elaboration to get information into memory.

B) The testing effect is the finding that actively retrieving information (for example, by taking a quiz or test) improves later memory for that material more than simply restudying it. Each time you recall information, the act of retrieval strengthens the memory trace and makes that information easier to access in the future.

C) Working memory is a limited-capacity system for the active maintenance and manipulation of information currently in use, such as when you hold numbers in mind while doing a calculation. Without rehearsal, information in working memory typically lasts for about 15 to 20 seconds before fading.

D) Implicit memory is unconscious memory that influences behavior or performance without deliberate awareness, such as procedural memory for riding a bike or priming effects that make a recently seen word easier to recognize. Explicit memory is conscious, intentional memory of past experiences and facts, such as episodic memories of specific events in your life or semantic memories like knowing the capital of a country.
