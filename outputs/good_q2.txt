- Intentionality: Consciousness is always about something; it is directed toward objects, events, or states in the world or in the mind.
- Unity: Consciousness takes information from different senses and mental processes and integrates it into one coherent, unified experience.
- Selectivity: Consciousness involves focusing attention on some pieces of information while ignoring or filtering out other information.
- Transience: Transience means that consciousness can hold on to the same thought permanently without ever changing or moving to anything else.

C)
- Minimal consciousness: A low-level state in which the mind registers sensations and may produce simple behaviors, such as turning toward a sound or withdrawing from pain, without full awareness.
- Full consciousness: A higher level of awareness in which a person is not only experiencing mental states but can also reflect on them and report what they are thinking and feeling.
- Self-consciousness: Self-consciousness is when a person is not aware of themselves at all and is more like being completely unconscious, such as in deep sleep.

D)
- Depressants: These reduce CNS activity, slowing down brain function and bodily processes.
- Stimulants: These increase CNS activity, speeding up brain function and arousal.
- Narcotics/opioids: These produce pain relief and feelings of euphoria by acting on the brain’s opioid receptors.
- Hallucinogens: These alter perception and sensory experience, often causing vivid distortions in how reality is seen or felt.
