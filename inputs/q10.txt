# A) Stressors (40 points total):
## Provides a clear definition of stressor: event or demand that threatens well-being or requires adjustment. (20 points)
## Distinguishes acute (short-term/time-limited) versus chronic stressors (persistent/long-term). (20 points)
# B) Physiological response (30 points total):
## Adequately identifies the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis or HPA axis (acronym is sufficient). (10 points)
## Briefly describes the role of the HPA axis: the hypothalamus signals the pituitary, which prompts the adrenal cortex to release cortisol and other hormones. (20 points)
# C) General adaptation syndrome (30 points total):
## Describes alarm phase: initial mobilization to threat and fight-or-flight. (10 points)
## Describes resistance phase: sustained coping with continued stress, elevated but managed arousal, and attempts to adapt. (10 points)
## Describes exhaustion phase: resources depleted after prolonged stress and increased risk to health or impaired functioning. (10 points)
