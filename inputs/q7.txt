# A) Intelligence and IQ (30 points total):
## States intelligence involves using the mind to solve problems and learn from experience. (15 points)
## Explain that IQ is operationalized as a standardized score that compares an individual’s performance to population norms. (15 points)
# B) Twin studies and heritability (40 points total):
## Explains that higher IQ correlations among monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins suggest a genetic influence, as monozygotic twins share more genes. (20 points)
## Defines h2 as the proportion of variance in IQ scores within a population that is attributable to genetic differences, emphasizing that it applies to populations, not individuals. (20 points)
# C) Environmental influences on IQ (30 points total):
## Points awarded for up to three of the following (10 points each): 
### (1) Socioeconomic status (SES).
### (2) Education.
### (3) Nutrition.
### (4) Prenatal environment.
