# A) Classical conditioning (25 points total):
## Explains that some stimulus pairings are learned more easily due to species-specific biological or evolutionary predispositions (preparedness). (15 points)
## Identifies the amygdala as important for fear conditioning. (10 points)
# B) Positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement (30 points total):
## Defines positive reinforcement as adding a stimulus to increase a behaviour. (15 points)
## Defines negative reinforcement as removing an aversive stimulus to increase a behaviour. (15 points)
# C) Shaping (15 points):
## Defines shaping as reinforcing successive approximations toward a target behaviour.
# D) Observational learning and implicit learning (30 points total):
## Describes observational learning as learning by watching others. (10 points)
## Describes implicit learning as unconscious learning of patterns. (10 points)
## Mentions mirror neuron system or motor cortical regions as involved in observational learning. (10 points)
