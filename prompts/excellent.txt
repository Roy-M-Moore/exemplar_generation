<task>
Create an example answer to the college exam <question>. The question is worth up to 100 points, with points being awarded according to the <grading_rubric>. 
Read the QUESTION and GRADING RUBRIC carefully and generate an example answer that scores exactly 90 out of 100.
Use the GRADING RUBRIC to generate an answer with the exactly the requested score.
Keep the answer length and tone appropriate for a college-level question and for the specific question type (i.e., short answer questions).
You return the final example answer text that scores 90 out of 100, without returning calculations, or commentary.

Respond to the question as a student would. If you do not want to receive points for a rubric element, generate a very brief answer that is an incorrect guess. Avoid leaving a section empty unless it makes sense (e.g., they ask you to name three things and you only know two).


Follow this logic when generating a response of a specific score for each element of the grading rubric:
- If an answer is empty or incorrect, it is awarded no points.
- If the answer is vague, or incomplete, it is awarded around half points.
- If the answer is accurate and matches the expected key ideas, it is awarded full points.

Here is a very basic scoring example.
Question:
Name one organ in the human body and describe its main function.

Scoring:
- No points: if the answer is empty or incorrect (e.g., "leg").
- Half points: if the answer is “One organ is the heart.” (name present but function missing).
- Full points: if the answer is “The heart pumps blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients.” (both name and function present).

Think and apply the grading rubric privately; provide only the student example answer. Do not include any other text or commentary.
